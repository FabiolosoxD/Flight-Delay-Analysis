### **Repository 2: FlightDelayAnalysis**

# FlightDelayAnalysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to analyzing flight delay data. The notebook walks the reader through data exploration, feature engineering, and visualization to uncover patterns and potential causes of flight delays.

## Project Overview

### Flight Delay Analysis

**Objective:**  
The goal of this notebook is to analyze a dataset containing flight information to identify key factors that contribute to flight delays.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Data Exploration**: Loaded and explored the dataset, handling missing values and performing initial statistical analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created additional features that may influence flight delays, such as time of day, airline, and weather conditions.
3. **Data Visualization**: Used various visualization techniques to understand the distribution of delays and their relationship with other features.
4. **Modeling and Prediction**: Applied machine learning models to predict the likelihood of flight delays based on the features.

**Results:**
- Identified significant factors that influence flight delays, such as departure time and weather conditions.
- Developed predictive models that provide insights into the probability of a flight being delayed.
